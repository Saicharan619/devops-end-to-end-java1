Maven + SonarQube + Docker + GCP Kubernetes CI/CD Pipeline 🚀
This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline leveraging Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Docker, Docker Hub, and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). It automates the process of building a Java application, performing code quality analysis, containerizing it, and deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster on GCP.

🔧 Tech Stack
Java + Maven: Build and manage dependencies for the Java application.

SonarQube: Perform static code analysis and ensure code quality.

Jenkins: Orchestrates the end-to-end CI/CD pipeline.

Docker: Containerizes the Java application for deployment.

Docker Hub: Stores and distributes Docker images.

Google Cloud Platform (GKE): Deploy the containerized application to Kubernetes.

Terraform (optional): Provision infrastructure for GKE clusters.

🔄 CI/CD Workflow
Jenkinsfile Stages:
Clone Git Repo: Fetch the source code from GitHub.

Maven Build: Compile the Java application and run tests.

SonarQube Analysis: Perform static analysis for code quality.

Docker Build: Build the Docker image for the application.

Push Docker Image: Push the image to Docker Hub.

Authenticate to GCP: Set up authentication for GCP services.

Update Kubernetes Deployment: Modify the Kubernetes deployment YAML with the new Docker image.

Deploy to GKE: Apply the Kubernetes manifest to deploy the application on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

🔐 Jenkins Credentials Required
Make sure the following credentials are set up in Jenkins:

sonar-token: SonarQube access token for analysis.

docker-hub: Docker Hub username and password for pushing images.

gcp-key: GCP service account key for deploying to GKE.

⚙️ How to Trigger the Pipeline
You can trigger the Jenkins pipeline manually or automatically via webhook on commit.

🎯 Outcome
Java Application: Automatically built using Maven.

Code Quality: SonarQube analysis ensures code quality checks.

Docker Image: Containerized and pushed to Docker Hub.

Deployment: Application is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster on GKE.

🛠️ Future Improvements
Integrate Quality Gate for SonarQube to automatically fail builds based on quality issues.

Add Slack notifications for build success or failure.

Migrate from raw Kubernetes YAML to using Helm for easier management.

Full Terraform integration for GKE cluster provisioning.

A seamless DevOps pipeline that automates building, testing, and deploying applications with efficiency and scalability.
